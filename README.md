# Digital Product School Challenge

[Digital Product School (DPS)](https://www.digitalproductschool.io/) is a 3 months training program to empower the next generation of digital product makers, where diverse and cross-functional teams solve real-world challenges.

This repository contains what I developed as the AI Track challenge. The challenge is to predict the `total` number of accidents (under `accident_type`) in Munich for the year of 2020.
